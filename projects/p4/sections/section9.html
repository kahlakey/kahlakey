			<h3 id="bookname9">Sunday Suppers</h3>
			<p id="description">Sunday Suppers was a lucky find. I only bought it because I liked the cover and I saw one recipe inside I wanted to try (I won't be buying another cookbook for those reasons again) but turns out this woman knows her stuff. My absolute favorite recipe from this book is the corned beef, but it needs 6 days to brine and I'm guessing most people don't have that kind of time. My second favorite recipe is the Shakshuka. This is a Middle Eastern inspired dish that's like eggs and salsa on steroids. It comes together super easily and tastes amazing.</p>

			<div class="instructions9">
				<p>In a large skillet heat olive oil over med-high heat. Add pepper, bay leaf, onion and garlic and cook for five minutes until onion is soft and wilted. Add harissa, salt, pepper, paprika, fennel seeds, cumin and coriander.</p>
				<p>Cook for a minute, stirring constantly to release the fragrance. 
				Add the ripe and canned tomatoes and tomato paste, reduce heat to medium. Cook 12-15 minutes until sauce has thickened.</p>
				<p>With the back of a spoon, make indentations for each egg you plan to cook. Crack an egg into each indentation and lightly season with salt, pepper and drizzles of olive oil. Cover, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until eggs are done to your liking, 10-12 minutes for fully cooked. Garnish with the chopped parsley and serve. Serves 4-6. </p>
