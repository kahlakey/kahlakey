			<p id="description">The Food and Cooking of Ireland was my first foray into cultural cooking. Irish food doesn't seem very diverse but it definitely has food specific to the Green Isle. When people think Irish food they think Corned Beef and Cabbage, but that's an Irish American dish. In reality Irish cooking involves a lot of lamb and bacon, leeks, and of course, potatoes. I contemplated naming Irish lamb stew as my favorite recipe from this book but, nothing beats perfect, golden, buttermilk pancakes. These babies are to die for. And make sure to eat them with honey, not syrup, they'll be so much better.</p>

	<img class="foodpic" src="../p4foodimages/irelandpancakes/1.JPG">
		<div class="ingredients2">
			<ul>2 cups all purpose flour</ul>
			<ul>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</ul>
			<ul>2-4 tbls sugar</ul>
			<ul>1 egg</ul>
			<ul> About 1 1/4 cups buttermilk</ul>
			<ul>butter and oil, mixed, for frying</ul>
			<ul>honey, to serve</ul>
		</div>
			<div class="instructions2">
				<p>In a food processor or a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda and sugar to taste. Add the egg, mix together and gradually pour in just enough of the buttermilk to make a thick, smooth batter.</p>
				<p>Heat a heavy pan and add the butter and oil mix. Place spoonfuls of the batter on to the hot pan and cook 2-3 minutes until bubbles rise to the surface. Flip pancakes and cook another 2-3 minutes. Remove from pan and serve warm with honey.</p>
