<p class="section14">Norma Jeane Changes Name to Marilyn Monroe</p>
<p class="section15">Norma Jeane chose to celebrate her good fortune with her new associates -- Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels. 
The first order of business was to change the young actress's name -- Lyon utterly loathed "Norma Jeane Dougherty."
Lyon remembered a stage actress from the 1920s whom he had long admired -- a musical performer named Marilyn Miller. He thought "Marilyn" would better suit Norma Jeane's new, glamorous identity as a Hollywood starlet.
For her part, Norma Jeane suggested her mother's family name, "Monroe," as a last name. Lyon liked the alliteration of "Marilyn Monroe," and told Norma Jeane that the double "M" was a lucky omen. So it was that in the course of one afternoon, Norma Jeane Mortenson Baker Dougherty was transformed into Marilyn Monroe.
She was forever grateful to Lyon for his support and his help. A few years later, when Marilyn Monroe was on top, she sent Lyon a photograph inscribed: "You found me, named me and believed in me when no one else did. <a href="s6.html">My love and thanks forever.</a>"
