		<h3>Norma Jeane Changes Name to Marilyn Monroe</h3>
	</div>
<div class="section15">
<p>Norma Jeane chose to celebrate her good fortune with her new associates -- Ben Lyon and Bebe Daniels. 
The first order of business was to change the young actress's name -- Lyon utterly loathed "Norma Jeane Dougherty."
Lyon remembered a stage actress from the 1920s whom he had long admired -- a musical performer named Marilyn Miller. He thought "Marilyn" would better suit Norma Jeane's new, glamorous identity as a Hollywood starlet.</p>
<p>For her part, Norma Jeane suggested her mother's family name, "Monroe," as a last name. Lyon liked the alliteration of "Marilyn Monroe," and told Norma Jeane that the double "M" was a lucky omen. So it was that in the course of one afternoon, Norma Jeane Mortenson Baker Dougherty was transformed into Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p>She was forever grateful to Lyon for his support and his help. A few years later, when Marilyn Monroe was on top, she sent Lyon a photograph inscribed: "You found me, named me and believed in me when no one else did. <a href="s6.html">My love and thanks forever.</a>"
